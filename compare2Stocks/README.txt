This program can graph two secutities next to eachother. Its fairly simple, but I wanted to keep some code to allow for multiple sub-graphs in matplotlib. I also use it to monitor gold vs spy, since gold can act as a hedge when spy experiences recessions. You must change the tickers to change the securities for which the test is run on. (Use my installs in PyFinance-Projects/extras/ under "installs.txt" if you need to update or install any libraries)
