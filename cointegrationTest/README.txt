This program finds all cointegrated pairs within a pool of securities. In the future, I will also add a kalman filter backtest for all sufficiently cointegrated pairs and then sort by sharpe ratios/total returns. You must change the tickers to change the securities for which the test is run on. (Use my installs in PyFinance-Projects/extras/ under "installs.txt" if you need to update or install any libraries)
