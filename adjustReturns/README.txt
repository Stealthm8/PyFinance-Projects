This program finds the annualized return and volatility for each security within a pool of securities, and sorts from best to worst based on a return-to-volatility ratio. It then excludes securities which have a trailingPE < forwardPE, a trailing PE < 10, as well as a ratio that is less than SPY. Once finished, take the top 5-10 securities and input them into an efficient portfoilio frontier optimizer to create an optimized portfolio. By defualt, the test will run on every ticker within the S&P500. You must change the tickers to change the securities for which the test is run on, as well as the starting date for the data.
