This program finds the annualized return and volatility for each security within a pool of securities, and sorts from best to worst based on a return-to-volatility ratio. You must change the tickers to change the securities for which the test is run on, as well as the starting date for the data. (Use my installs in PyFinance-Projects/extras/ under "installs.txt" if you need to update or install any libraries)
