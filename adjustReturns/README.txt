This program finds the annualized return and volatility for each security within a pool of securities, and sorts from best to worst based on a return-to-volatility ratio. By defualt, the test will run on every ticker within the S&P500. You must change the tickers to change the securities for which the test is run on, as well as the starting date for the data. (Use my installs in PyFinance-Projects/extras/ under "installs.txt" if you need to update or install any libraries)
